        <h3>Instructions of cooking chapati</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Add 3 cups of flour in a bowl.</li>
          <li>
            Add salt, sugar, 2 tbsp of oil and 1 Â½ cups of water in a separate
            jar/ bowl. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the liquid mixture in step 2 in the flour bowl (step 1) and mix
            well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep kneading for 10 minutes and add flour if needed until the dough
            becomes non-sticky. Add 2-3 tbsp of oil and continue kneading until
            the oil mixes well and the dough is soft. Cover the dough and leave
            it for 40 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the 40 minutes, divide the dough into 10 - 15 equal parts
            making ball like shapes. Arrange them in a flat surface dusted with
            flour(Cover with a damp tablecloth to avoid drying).
          </li>
          <li>
            Dust flour in the flat place and take one of the balls and start
            rolling with a rolling pin to a circular shape, brush oil on top and
            roll it inwards to form a shape-like a rope, then create a coil-like
            shape and press the ball down with your palm to make it flat. Repeat
            this process to the rest of the remaining balls of dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, start rolling each of the coil-like shape doughs with the
            rolling pin to form a circular shape again.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a hot pan, place the rolled out circular chapati and fry each
            side with little oil until its golden brown on medium heat. Place
            your cooked chapati in a flat plat and cover with an aluminum foil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat this step to the rest of the coil-like dough. *Serve with
            your favourite stew
